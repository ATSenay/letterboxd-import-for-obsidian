# letterboxd-import-for-obsidian
Import your Letterboxd diary CSV and create markdown files for each movie with posters and metadata. I wanted a way to show watched movies in a Base in Obsidian. 

1. Get your free TMDB API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
2. Export your diary from Letterboxd (https://letterboxd.com/settings/data/ Settings, Import & Export, Export Your Data). This zipped folder will have different files for your diary, watchlist, reviews, and others.
3. Before importing into Obsidian, change the options to enter your TMDB API key, name the output folder, size of the poster, and any tags you want on each file. Use the ribbon icon or the command "Import Letterboxd Diary CSV" to select your diary.csv file
4. Movie files will be created in the specified output folder with poster images and metadata

Bases can be created to show all the movies in specific folders, ratings, release years, or anything you want to show. I wanted a way to show watched movies in a base in Obsidian but if you have a lot of watched movies the graph may get out of control. The import doesn't take too long. I used large posters and there are about 2500 movies on my graph. Here's my example graph, what one of the files looks like, and a base example for 1993 movies that I rated 5/5. The movie posters are not 100% accurate, but the Letterboxd link will go to the right page.
