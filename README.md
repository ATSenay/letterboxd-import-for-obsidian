This zipped folder will have different files for your diary, watchlist, reviews, and others.

Before importing into Obsidian, change the options to name the output folder, size of the poster, and any tags you want on each file.

Bases can be created to show all the movies in specific folders, ratings, release years, or anything you want to show. Here's my example graph.
